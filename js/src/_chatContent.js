			'This app works in two ways:',
			'1. What happens when you get symptoms and how to manage?',
			'2. To help you keep a diary of your symptoms.',
			'It is common for people to experience more than one symptom. It is more useful, however, to focus on one at a time. Please select the symptom that affects you most from the symptom bubbles. (If your symptom does not appear, please type it in)',

	what: {
		title: 'What is FND?',
		chat: [
			' Functional neurological symptoms is an umbrella term use for a variety of symptoms which relate to neurological features which are not due to physical damage to the nervous system. These symptoms arise due to a problem with the function, rather than structure of the nervous system.',

			'It is quite common for the diagnosis of functional neurological disorders to take a long time, and patients often find that they have seen multiple specialist before they receive the diagnosis. This process can sometimes be frustrating.',

			'It’s useful to think of the problem as being due to messages which are not being communicated effectively between the brain and body. It is like a computer having a software problem rather than a hardware problem.'

	why : {
		title: 'Why do I have FND?',
		chat:[
			'Often we do not know 100% why the symptoms started and our models of why people get functional symptoms are incomplete.',
			'There are many potential reasons why someone might become vulnerable to functional symptoms.  There might be things that happened before the symptoms started (Predisposing Factors); things that happened around the time that the symptoms started (Precipitating Factors) and things that happened after the symptoms started (Perpetuating or Maintaining Factors).',
			'What is the treatment?',
			'The treatment of FND depends largely on the specific symptoms, however usually it is a combination of psychological therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychiatric input.   CBT approaches have been used successfully as part of the psychological therapy process, and this is the main aspect we will focus on within this app.'

	// // Breathe in while the shape is unfolding, breathe out while the shape refolds.

	// // 2)Finger tap:
	// // On both hands tap your index finger on your thumb, moving on to tap each finger and then back again. Repeat this until you feel able to continue. 

	// // Insert GIF

	// // 3) Mindfulness:
	// // Whatever you do, be in this moment.  Focus your attention,  notice what you see around you.    Listen to the sounds around.  Notice your senses, smell, touch, hearing. Reach out and touch what is within reach - the chair, the floor.  Notice those sensations of breathing in your body. Take a deep breath. Simply notice as thoughts and sensations come to mind,  then gently re-focus. Be patient and kind with yourself. Describe your experiences and what you notice, rather than judging. It is as it is. It will pass.
