	'Focus/Relaxation techniques': [
	// 1)Mindful Breathing
	// Breathe in while the shape is unfolding, breathe out while the shape refolds.
	// Repeat until you feel able to continue.

	// 2)Finger tap:
	// On both hands tap your index finger on your thumb, moving on to tap each finger and then back again. Repeat this until you feel able to continue.

	// Insert GIF

	// 3) Mindfulness:
	// Whatever you do, be in this moment. Focus your attention, notice what you see around you. Listen to the sounds around. Notice your senses, smell, touch, hearing. Reach out and touch what is within reach - the chair, the floor. Notice those sensations of breathing in your body. Take a deep breath. Simply notice as thoughts and sensations come to mind, then gently re-focus. Be patient and kind with yourself. Describe your experiences and what you notice, rather than judging. It is as it is. It will pass.

	// 4) Distraction:
	// Insert audio
